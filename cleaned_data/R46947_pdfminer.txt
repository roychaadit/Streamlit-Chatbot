U.S. Climate Change Policy 

The greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere trap radiant energy, warming earth’s surface 
and oceans. Scientific assessments conclude that GHGs very likely have been the main driver of 
warming of the earth’s lower atmosphere since 1979. The most recent global assessment 
projected that surface temperature would continue to rise until at least mid-century even under 
the lowest GHG emission scenarios considered. A range of actions to mitigate GHG emissions 
and the risks of climate change (i.e., for adaptation or resilience) are under way or being 
developed on the international, national, and subnational levels. U.S. federal policymakers and 
stakeholders have different viewpoints regarding what, if anything, to do about future climate 
change and related impacts.  

Brief History of U.S. Climate Policy 
Historically, the United States has demonstrated varying approaches and intent with regard to 
addressing climate change generally and to participating in GHG abatement under the 1992 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). International 
negotiations led to, among other agreements, the adoption of the Paris Agreement (PA) in 2015. 
President Obama accepted the PA without submitting it to the Senate for advice and consent, and 
the United States became a Party to the agreement when the PA entered into force in 2016. 
President Trump announced U.S. withdrawal from the PA in June 2017, which became effective 
in November 2020. President Biden again accepted the PA, and the United States became a Party 
on February 19, 2021. 

U.S. climate change policy has involved actions implemented under various legal authorities. 
Prior to 2007, the federal government implemented voluntary programs to address climate 
change and regulatory programs that indirectly limited GHG emission increases from vehicles, 
appliances and equipment, and buildings. A shift toward direct regulation of GHG emissions 
occurred following the 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, in which the Supreme Court 
found that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authority to regulate GHG emissions 
from motor vehicles as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. EPA subsequently issued rules to 
limit GHGs from various sources, although not all have been implemented. State and local 
governments have also taken a variety of actions, including emission controls on power plants 
and vehicles and building codes.

U.S. Legislation 
Members of Congress have historically expressed a range of perspectives regarding climate change issues. Legislative 
proposals have included carbon pricing frameworks (e.g., carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs), sectoral approaches such 
as a clean energy standard, research funding or tax policies that support GHG-abating technology development and 
deployment, efforts to increase adaptation, and international cooperation. On the other hand, introduced resolutions have 
expressed that the multisector carbon pricing approaches are not in the economic interests of the United States. Votes on 
comprehensive climate change policy have been relatively rare in either chamber of Congress. Examples of enacted 
legislation involving climate change issues include tax incentives to promote renewable energy sources and carbon capture 
and sequestration efforts. 

Executive Branch Approach to Climate Change 
President Biden announced a new GHG target for the United States: to reduce net GHG emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 
levels by 2030. The Administration has also centralized executive branch organizations to identify and coordinate climate-
related actions, and issued directives with a view toward decisions that support meeting the Administration’s GHG reduction 
targets.  

Issues for Congress 
Congress may consider issues concerning U.S. GHG targets, policy approaches, and funding. For example, U.S. participation 
in the PA raises issues that Congress may consider concerning the ambition, relative level of effort, and performance of other 
parties’ GHG mitigation, adaptation, technology, and financing associated with the PA. Differences in parties’ GHG policies

may have implications for trade. For example, several national governments and the EU have discussed imposing border 
carbon adjustments (i.e., tariffs) on imported goods from countries that do not make similarly ambitious efforts to reduce 
GHG emissions.

U.S. Climate Change Policy 

Introduction  
Millions of discrete sources throughout the U.S. economy produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.1 These sources include motor vehicles, electric power 
plants, industrial facilities, commercial buildings, and households, among others. Human-related 
GHG emissions have increased since the beginning of the industrial era, unequivocally increasing 
atmospheric concentrations of GHGs.2 For example, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have 
increased by over 45% compared to preindustrial levels.3 Methane has increased by 156% over 
the same time frame.4 

The GHGs in the atmosphere trap infrared radiation as heat, warming earth’s atmosphere, land, 
and ocean. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in 2021 that “[i]t 
is very likely that well-mixed GHGs were the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979”5 
and that “[g]lobal warming of 1.5°C and 2°C [compared with preindustrial temperatures] will be 
exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions occur 
in the coming decades.”6  

The increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs have led to various changes to the climate: 
increases in average global temperature and related rising sea levels, changes in precipitation, and 
increases in frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events. The latest major U.S. 
scientific assessment, known as the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4), concluded that 
the increase in GHGs is driving global land and ocean warming and other climate changes that 
are now unprecedented in the history of modern civilization. The second volume of the NCA4, 
published in 2018, concluded, inter alia, that human-induced climate change is affecting U.S. 
communities across the country through extreme weather events and generally warmer 
temperatures, more variable precipitation, and other observed trends.7 The NCA4 describes 
continued and increasing disruption to infrastructure, economic, and social systems, including 
economic disparities. According to its assessment, projected climate change impacts are affecting, 
and are virtually certain to increasingly affect, the U.S. economy, trade, and other essential U.S. 
interests. Some stakeholders, as well as some Members of Congress, consider that the resulting 

1 The primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by human activities—and estimated by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) in its annual inventories—include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur 
hexafluoride,   hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. Other GHGs include carbonaceous and 
sulfuric aerosols, hydro  and elevated tropospheric ozone pollution generated by emissions of 
nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, such as solvents.

impacts of climate change in the United States and abroad are and would be modest and 
manageable. 

A range of actions that seek to reduce GHG emissions are currently under way or being 
developed by international and subnational entities (e.g., financing by multilateral development 
banks, or U.S. state actions or regional partnerships), as well as by the U.S. federal government 
(e.g., support for carbon capture technologies). Nonetheless, Members of Congress and 
stakeholders have different viewpoints concerning what, if anything, to do about future climate 
change and related impacts. President Joseph Biden’s Administration has increased the ambition8 
of U.S. GHG reduction targets and announced a whole-of-government approach to addressing 
climate change. In the legislative branch, numerous Members of Congress have expressed a range 
of perspectives regarding climate change issues. Some Members seeking to take action on climate 
change have proposed a variety of legislative approaches. 

This report provides an overview of U.S. climate change policy as of September 2021. It begins 
with background on U.S. emission trends and a brief history of U.S. climate change policy, and 
discusses emissions mitigation activities at the subnational level, including state and regional 
programs. Next, the report discusses legislative developments, including recently enacted 
legislation related to climate change and legislative proposals in the 117th Congress. The report 
also considers executive branch actions and presents information about the Biden 
Administration’s GHG targets, announced policies, proposals for legislative action, and examples 
of other policy actions. The report concludes with issues for Congress.  

This report does not provide a comprehensive summary of these actions, given their breadth and 
continuously evolving nature. Rather, it aims to provide a snapshot of the current climate change 
policy landscape. Upcoming international discussions, strongly held public opinions, expected 
forthcoming scientific and economic reports, and other factors make it likely that climate change 
may continue to be a topic of deliberation and proposed actions in Congress. Moreover, 
developments may occur rapidly.  

U.S. Emission Trends 

The most recent U.S. GHG Inventory prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) reports annual emissions and emission sinks from 1990 through 2019.9 EPA’s inventory 
includes gross and net emission levels.10 As illustrated in Figure 1, the highest level of gross U.S. 
GHG emissions—15.6% above 1990 levels—occurred in 2007. Gross U.S. GHG emissions in 
2019 were 6,558 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions (MMTCO2e),11 

8 Ambition with regard to GHG targets is a term used internationally with regard to the magnitude of limitations or 
reductions sought by countries or other actors. 
9 Emission sinks, such as forests, vegetation, and soils, remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store the carbon. EPA, 
Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks,  
  
10 Gross emissions refer to total emissions from all sources, and it does not account for net removals of CO2 emissions 
from the atmosphere by vegetation and other sinks. U.S. sinks removed about 789 million metric tons (MMT) in 2019, 
about 12% of gross emissions. EPA, Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2019, April 14, 
2021,   
(Hereinafter, U.S. GHG Inventory, 1990-2019.) 
11 Million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MMTCO2e) is used because GHGs vary by global warming potential (GWP). 
GWP is an index that allows comparisons of the heat-trapping ability of different gases over a period of time.

which is 1.8% higher than 1990 GHG emission levels and 11.6% below 2005 levels—the year the 
United States uses as a benchmark for its international GHG pledges.12 

Figure 1 also shows the gross emissions contributions and trends by sector. The electricity sector 
historically accounted for the largest percentage of U.S. GHG emissions from fossil fuel 
combustion. As the figure indicates, emissions in the electricity sector decreased by 33% between 
2005 and 2019. As the side-by-side comparison in Figure 1 illustrates, the decrease in total U.S. 
GHG emissions over the past 15 years was largely related to decreases in the electricity sector. 
The evolving electricity generation portfolio played a key role in the emissions decrease in the 
electricity sector. Different fossil fuels, like coal and natural gas, generate different amounts of 
GHGs per unit of generated electricity. For example, a natural-gas unit typically yields about 40% 
of the GHG emissions of a coal-fired unit per megawatt-hour of electricity. Some sources of 
electricity generation, such as nuclear power, wind, and solar, emit no GHG emissions at the point 
of power generation. Over the past decade, coal’s contribution to electricity generation decreased, 
while natural gas and renewable generation both increased. Several factors likely played a role in 
this change, including technological advances, particularly hydraulic fracturing, as well as federal 
tax incentives for renewable energy and renewable portfolio standards in the states. These and 
other factors have affected the relative price differences between sources of electricity, 
influencing their deployment in the electricity sector.13 

Due to declines in the electricity sector emissions over the past decade, emissions from the 
transportation sector surpassed those from electricity in 2016.14 In 2019, the transportation sector 
accounted for 29% of total U.S. GHG emissions, and the electricity and industrial sectors 
accounted for 25% and 23%, respectively.

figure uses the economic sectors from EPA’s Inventory. EPA’s Inventory (Table 2-12) also presents emissions by 
economic sector, with the emissions from the electricity sector distributed to each sector based on the sector’s 
electricity use.  

History of U.S. Federal Climate Policy 
The United States has historically demonstrated varying approaches and intent with regard to 
addressing climate change generally and to participating in GHG abatement under the 1992 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).15 While the United 
States was instrumental in establishing the negotiations toward that treaty, it did not support 
binding GHG “targets and timetables” and financial assistance to lower-income countries to 
reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. The UNFCCC did not contain binding 
targets. 

15 U.N. Treaty Collection, Chapter XXIII. The U.S. Senate’s ratification of the UNFCCC in October 1992 was second 
among signatories and the first by an industrialized country. President George H. W. Bush transmitted the signed treaty 
to the Senate for its advice and consent in 138 Congressional Record 23902 (September 8, 1992). The U.S. Senate gave 
its advice and consent to ratification in 138 Congressional Record 33527 (October 7, 1992). See also S. Treaty Doc. 
102-38 (1992); S. Exec. Rept. 102-55. President Bush signed the instrument of ratification and submitted it to the 
United Nations on October 13, 1992. Depositary notification C.N.148.1993.

U.S. Climate Change Policy 

Why “Net-Zero” Emissions Targets? 
The UNFCCC stated an objective that effectively established a collective “net zero” GHG emissions commitment 
among parties to the agreement, with no specific target date. The UNFCCC objective is “to stabilize GHG 
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate 
system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.” 
Stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere requires that the balance of “gross” emissions of GHG minus 
the removals of GHG from the atmosphere reach “net zero” in order to halt any accumulation of emissions in the 
atmosphere that leads to climate change. The date would be determined by a policy decision (i.e., balancing more 
considerations than science alone) on what constitutes “dangerous ... interference in the climate system.” For more 
information, see CRS In Focus IF11821, Net-Zero Emissions Pledges: Background and Recent Developments, by Michael 
I. Westphal. 

The 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC included binding GHG targets for the industrialized 
countries, including the United States, listed in its Annex I (“Annex I Parties”), but no new 
commitments for developing countries.16 The United States signed but did not ratify this treaty. 
Following a stalemate in 2009 toward negotiation of a legal instrument that would include the 
United States, China, and other major emitting countries, the Barack Obama Administration led 
development of a more collaborative and bilateral relationship with China and others.17 This more 
collaborative process resulted in adoption of the Paris Agreement (PA) in 2015.18 President 
Obama accepted the agreement without submitting it to the Senate for advice and consent, and the 
United States became a Party to the agreement when the PA entered into force in 2016.19 
President Donald Trump announced U.S. withdrawal from the PA in June 2017, which, following 
the procedures of the treaty, became effective in November 2020. On President Biden’s first day 
in office, he accepted the PA, and the United States again became a Party on February 19, 2021.  

To date, U.S. climate change policy has involved actions—such as standards, investments, tax 
incentives, programs, and support for technology   under various legal 
authorities. Congress has previously deliberated comprehensive authority to address climate 
change, but votes on such legislation have been relatively rare. One example is H.R. 2454 in the 
111th Congress, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (“Waxman-Markey”), 
which would have established an economy-wide cap-and-trade system to reduce GHG emissions. 
The House passed H.R. 2454 in 2009. Although companion legislation in the Senate, S. 1733, 

16 United Nations Treaty Collection, Chapter XXVII: Environment, “7.a. Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change,” December 12, 2015,  
  The United States signed the Kyoto Protocol on 
November 12, 1998. However, in the “Byrd-Hagel” Resolution (S.Res. 98, 105th Congress, agreed to by a 95-0 vote), 
the Senate expressed its opposition by stating that the United States should not sign a treaty that (1) “would mandate 
new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or other 
agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 
Developing Country Parties,” or (2) “would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.” The Kyoto 
Protocol was never submitted to the Senate for ratification. For background on international treaties, see CRS Report 
RL32528, International Law and Agreements: Their Effect upon U.S. Law, by Stephen P. Mulligan.

it is structured. The targets are not binding; the elements that are binding are consistent with already approved previous 
agreements.” See U.S. Department of State, “Background Briefing on the Paris Climate Agreement,” December 12,

was ordered reported from the Committee on Environment and Public Works, the bill was not 
brought to the Senate floor for consideration. In the absence of new comprehensive legislative 
authority to reduce GHGs, the Obama Administration pursued GHG emissions abatement under 
existing authorities.20 State and local governments have also historically implemented a variety of 
climate change actions (see “Climate Mitigation Activities in U.S. States”).  

Mostly Voluntary or Indirect Federal Approaches Until 2010 

From negotiation of the UNFCCC through the mid-2000s, the federal government primarily 
relied on “no regrets” programs to address climate change, along with some efficiency regulation 
that also limited GHGs.21 The programs assisted agencies and nonfederal partners in achieving 
voluntary GHG reductions using technical assistance and reputational incentives offered by the 
EPA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
Examples include Energy Star, AgStar, and EPA’s Center for Corporate Climate Leadership 
programs.22 A number of studies, however, concluded that voluntary action alone could not 
substantially reduce GHG emissions.23 

Several regulatory programs indirectly limited GHG emission increases from vehicles, appliances 
and equipment, and buildings. These continue, and largely have had increasing influence on 
reducing GHG emissions as standards tightened over time. For example, the Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) set fuel economy targets, in miles per gallon, for newly manufactured 
passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States. These standards have the co-benefit of 
reducing GHG emissions from these vehicles.  

DOE’s conservation and energy efficiency programs provide another example of standards that 
indirectly limit GHGs. Congress has enacted several broad energy policy laws—including 
support for energy conservation and energy efficiency—since the 1970s, most recently the 
Energy Act of 2020 (Division Z of P.L. 116-260). The Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(EPCA; P.L. 94-163) authorized a federal program to establish minimum energy conservation 
standards for consumer products and industrial equipment, among other provisions. EPCA, as 
amended, authorizes DOE’s Appliance and Equipment Standards Program, which sets efficiency 
standards for approximately 60 product categories.24 The Energy Conservation and Production 
Act (ECPA; P.L. 94-385) established federal voluntary performance standards for new residential 
and commercial buildings and encouraged state and local governments to adopt and enforce 

20 White House, “Remarks by the President in the State of the Union Address,” February 12, 2013. 
21 A no regrets approach generally refers to policies that would provide benefits, such as economic, human health, or 
environmental benefits, regardless of future climate change.

standards through building codes, among other provisions. ECPA, as amended, also established 
federal building energy efficiency standards.25  

Congress established requirements for the federal government related to GHGs. The Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005; P.L. 109-58) established a renewable electricity goal for the 
federal government. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140) 
required agencies to report GHG emissions, although it did not specify what types of emissions. 
EPACT 2005 also established the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates that U.S. 
transportation fuels contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel; EISA subsequently expanded 
the RFS mandate.26 The RFS mandate requires that transportation fuels sold or introduced into 
commerce in the United States contain an increasing volume of a predetermined suite of 
renewable fuels.27 In order to be eligible for the RFS, a renewable fuel has to meet a GHG 
emission reduction threshold, among other criteria. The statute required 4.0 billion gallons of 
renewable fuel in 2006, ascending to 36.0 billion gallons required in 2022, with EPA determining 
the volume amounts after 2022 in future rulemakings.28 

After the mid-2000s, tax incentives and federal grants, including for research and development, 
increasingly supported renewable energy generation, biomass fuels, and lower-emission 
vehicles.29 Administrations, over decades, have supported research to develop technologies, such 
as renewable energy systems, that could achieve deeper GHG reductions and reduce the cost of 
doing so. Increases in tax incentives for technology deployment, along with growing competition 
among manufacturers, led to increased efficiencies and reduced costs of many technologies, 
including wind and solar electricity generation.30 

In late 2007, Congress directed EPA to establish a GHG reporting program. Specifically, the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161), provided $3.5 million for EPA to develop 
and publish a rule that would “require mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions above 
appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy of the United States.” In response to the 
congressional directive, EPA established the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). It 
requires reporting from facilities in nearly all categories of direct emitters and from suppliers of 
certain fuels and manufactured GHGs (e.g., fluorinated GHGs) in the United States. The broad 
scope of emissions data collected from these sources allows the agency to assess trends in 
emissions over time and within industry sectors for use in agency policy and programs. The

prevail. For more information, see CRS Report R44045, The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): Waiver Authority and

supporting renewables increased. For more information, see CRS Report R44852, The Value of Energy Tax Incentives

GHGRP does not impose emissions limits, but reporting programs may create transparency 
incentives for sources to limit their emissions due to public or reputational pressures.31 

Federal Regulation of GHGs Under Existing Authorities, 2010 to 
2021 

A shift toward direct federal regulation of GHG emissions occurred following the 2007 decision 
in Massachusetts v. EPA, in which the Supreme Court found that EPA has authority to regulate 
GHG emissions from motor vehicles as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act (CAA).32 In the 5-4 
decision, the Court’s majority concluded that EPA must decide whether GHG emissions from 
new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
public health or welfare—or provide a reasonable explanation why it cannot or will not make that 
decision. On December 15, 2009, EPA promulgated findings that six GHGs33 endanger both 
public health and welfare and that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to that 
endangerment. These findings are collectively referred to as the “endangerment finding.”  

Of the six GHGs discussed in EPA’s endangerment finding, CO2 is the most prevalent, 
accounting for about 80% of U.S. GHG emissions, on a CO2-equivalent basis, from human 
activities in 2019.34 The   gas in the United States in terms of emissions is 
methane (10% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2019), followed by nitrous oxide (7% in 2019).35 In 
2019, about two-thirds of domestic CO2 emissions were produced by the combustion of fossil 
fuels for energy and transportation.36 The primary sources of U.S. methane emissions include oil 
and natural gas systems, agriculture, and landfills,37 and the primary source of nitrous oxide 
emissions is agricultural soil management.38  

The endangerment finding triggered EPA’s duty under CAA Section 202(a) to promulgate 
emission standards for new motor vehicles, which are discussed below.39 EPA has also since 
issued rules to limit GHGs under other CAA authorities. For example, the agency promulgated 
regulations under CAA Section 111 to limit GHGs from the electricity sector, the oil and gas

32 549 U.S. 497 (2007). The Court held that GHGs are air pollutants within the Clean Air Act’s (CAA’s) definition of 
that term and that EPA must regulate their emissions from motor vehicles if the agency finds that such emissions cause 
or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. See CRS Report 
R43699, Key Historical Court Decisions Shaping EPA’s Program Under the Clean Air Act, by Linda Tsang. The Clean 
Air Act is codified as 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.

industry, and municipal solid waste landfills. EPA also finalized, in consultation with the Federal 
Aviation Administration, CO2 emission standards for civilian aircraft under CAA Section 231 in 
January 2021.40 EPA developed the aircraft standards in line with the internationally negotiated 
standards agreed to by parties to the International Civil Aviation Organization. 

The remainder of this section discusses GHG rules for vehicles, power plants, oil and natural gas 
systems, and municipal solid waste landfills that were promulgated prior to the Biden 
Administration.  

Vehicle Fuel Economy and GHG Standards 

As noted previously, transportation emissions are currently the largest source of GHG emissions 
in the United States.41 In 2010, the Obama Administration brokered an agreement among 13 auto 
manufacturers, the State of California,42 the United Auto Workers union, and other interested 
parties for GHG emission standards for automobiles and light trucks. EPA promulgated these 
GHG standards, which aligned with NHTSA’s CAFE program, as well as with those developed 
by California to facilitate a “single national standard” for manufacturers.43 EPA and NHTSA also 
promulgated two phases of fuel efficiency and GHG standards for newly manufactured heavy-
duty vehicles and engines (e.g., long-haul tractor-trailers, buses, and construction and utility 
vehicles).44 

In 2020, EPA and NHTSA promulgated the SAFE Vehicles Rule, which relaxed the GHG and 
fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles.45 EPA also withdrew the waiver that had allowed 
California to set GHG emission standards stronger than the national standards to meet 
“compelling and extraordinary conditions,” as authorized under the CAA.46 Various states, local 
governments, and environmental and consumer organizations filed petitions for review in the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the SAFE Vehicles Rule.

Climate Change, by Richard K. Lattanzio.  
41 U.S. GHG Inventory, 1990-2019. 
42 The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as amended, and the CAA, as amended, generally preempt states 
from adopting their own fuel economy and emission standards for new motor vehicles. However, CAA Section 209(b) 
allows the State of California to request a preemption waiver for its vehicle emission standards provided that they are at 
least as stringent as federal standards and, among other things, are necessary to meet “compelling and extraordinary 
conditions.” For this reason, California has typically been involved in all federal vehicle emissions rulemakings.

Power Plants and GHG Standards 

To limit CO2 from the electricity sector, currently the second-largest emitting source category in 
the United States,47 EPA in 2015 promulgated New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for 
new and modified fossil-fuel-fired power plants48 and—for existing plants—the Clean Power 
Plan (CPP).49 The CPP was the subject of ongoing litigation and was never implemented. While 
the NSPS remain in place, the Trump Administration repealed the CPP and finalized a new rule, 
the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, to limit CO2 from existing power plants. The ACE rule 
applied a narrower interpretation than the CPP of the “best system of emission reduction,” 
defining it as on-site “heat rate improvement” measures, also known as efficiency improvements, 
for existing coal-fired units.50 In January 2021, a federal appellate court vacated and remanded 
the ACE rule to EPA, and it remains unclear how EPA may act on the rule.51 The CPP and ACE 
rules, issued under separate Administrations, relied on different interpretations of EPA’s CAA 
authority, which may raise questions about EPA’s potential approach to regulating GHG 
emissions under the CAA. 

Although federal requirements to limit GHG emissions in the electricity sector have not been 
implemented,52 GHG emissions in the sector declined by 33% between 2005 and 2019, as 
discussed earlier in this report. See “U.S. Emission Trends” and Figure 1.  

Oil and Natural Gas Systems, Solid Waste Landfills, and GHG Standards 

Under the Obama Administration, federal activities in support of GHG emissions reductions in 
various industrial sectors became a cornerstone of President Obama’s “Climate Action Plan.” The 
Administration promulgated several regulations to address these emissions, including 

  EPA standards to reduce methane emissions from new and modified activities 
and equipment in the oil and natural gas sector (finalized on June 3, 2016);53 
  EPA standards to reduce methane emissions from new and existing municipal 

solid waste landfills (finalized on August 29, 2016);54 and

51 The court directed EPA to reconsider its interpretation of its CAA Section 111(d) authority to regulate GHGs from 
existing power plants. The court also vacated the CPP repeal but stayed its mandate until the EPA responds to the 
court’s remand in a new rulemaking action. 
52 Under the ACE rule, states were to establish performance standards for designated facilities through state plans. A 
federal appellate court vacated and remanded the ACE rule to EPA before the date—July 8, 2022—that state plans 
were due to EPA.

  Bureau of Land Management (BLM) standards to prevent the waste of gas (i.e., 

methane) through venting and flaring during oil and natural gas production on 
public lands (finalized on November 18, 2016).55 

President Trump subsequently signed Executive Order 13783 on March 28, 2017, requiring 
agencies to review existing regulations and “appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind those that 
unduly burden” domestic energy production and use. Further, the federal courts reviewed 
provisions in the Obama-era standards and the Trump Administration’s revisions. As a result, the 
status of federal methane regulation was as follows by the end of the Trump Administration: 

  EPA rescinded the 2016 methane standards for the oil and gas sector (September 
14, 2020).56 (See also “Recently Enacted Legislation Related to GHGs” for 
related legislative action undertaken in 2021, in particular, S.J.Res. 14 and P.L. 
117-23, which disapproved the 2020 policy revisions of EPA’s 2016 methane 
standards for the oil and natural gas sector. Although most of the requirements 
under EPA’s 2016 rule are back in force, their fate remains unclear because of 
pending legislative, executive, and judicial actions.57) 

  The 2016 methane standards for new and existing municipal solid waste landfills 
remain in effect.58 Stakeholders have challenged the 2016 methane standards for 
existing landfills in court, but the litigation is on hold.59 

  BLM rescinded the 2016 waste prevention standards for the oil and gas sector 
(September 28, 2018). A California federal district court vacated the rescission 
(July 15, 2020);60 however, a Wyoming federal district court subsequently 
vacated all provisions in the 2016 rule related to the loss of gas (October 8, 
2020).61 Appellate litigation is ongoing.62  

Climate Mitigation Activities in U.S. States 
In the absence of comprehensive federal controls on GHG emissions, state and local governments 
have taken a variety of actions―both legal mandates and voluntary efforts―for nearly 20 years. 
Generally, these efforts include emission controls on power plants and vehicles; building codes;

and other actions. In particular, a number of U.S. states have mandatory GHG reduction 
programs, including the following:  

  California has a GHG emissions cap-and-trade program that went into effect in 

2013 that applies to electric power, selected industries, and fossil fuel 
distributors.63 The program is linked with a cap-and-trade program in the 
Canadian province of Quebec. The program is a key component of the state’s 
plan to meet its legislated target of reducing GHG emissions 40% below 1990 
levels by 2030.64 

  Eleven U.S. states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 

(RGGI),65 a cap-and-trade program on CO2 emissions from electric power that 
went into effect in 2009. The RGGI states have revised their program over time. 
The most recent revision aims to reduce power-sector emissions in the 11 states 
to 30% below 2020 levels by 2030.66 

  Thirty states, three U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have mandatory 
electricity portfolio standards (clean energy standards or renewable portfolio 
standards), which require a minimum amount of electricity be generated by 
eligible sources such as renewables. Of these, 11 jurisdictions are to ultimately 
require 100% of electricity to come from eligible clean sources.67  

  Regarding vehicle emissions, California set standards in 2009, jointly with the 

federal government, to increase fuel efficiency and reduce GHG emissions from 
many types of on-road vehicles.68 California also set standards to require auto 
manufacturers to increase the number of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) sold in 
the state.69 Fourteen other states and the District of Columbia adopted 
California’s vehicle standards.70 California’s authority to set these standards 
under the CAA was preempted by the Trump Administration, but related

65 The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) states are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Vermont. Through executive branch action, 
Pennsylvania is seeking to join RGGI. Some policymakers in Pennsylvania’s legislative bodies have voiced strong 
opposition to joining RGGI and the governor’s actions to join the program without enacting new legislation.

litigation paused in February 2021 so the incoming Biden Administration could 
review and potentially revise the rule. Additionally, 45 states and the District of 
Columbia provide incentives for electric vehicles and/or hybrids. The incentives 
range from tax credits or rebates to fleet acquisition goals, exemptions from 
emissions testing, or favorable electricity rate treatment.71 Further, seven states 
have some version of a low carbon fuel standard or alternative fuel standard.72 
Additionally, 13 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states plus the District of Columbia 
have sought policies to reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector, 
and are seeking to use a policy modeled on RGGI and coordinated through the 
Transportation and Climate Initiative.73 

When President Trump announced in June 2017 his intention to withdraw the United States from 
the PA, some U.S. mayors, county executives, governors, tribal leaders, college and university 
leaders, businesses, faith groups, and investors formed the We Are Still In organization to pledge 
and demonstrate nonfederal climate change actions to the international community.74 In addition, 
the U.S. Climate Alliance, which includes governors from 24 states and Puerto Rico, announced a 
commitment to reduce net GHG emissions from their states at least 50%-52% below 2005 levels 
by 2030 and to achieve net-zero GHG emissions no later than 2050.75 The degree to which state 
and local governments can achieve these targets without federal action is uncertain, as the legal 
authorities and jurisdictions over GHG emissions sources may be limited in some cases. 

U.S. Legislative Action 
Members of Congress have historically expressed a range of perspectives regarding climate 
change issues and have proposed a variety of legislative approaches. Legislative proposals have 
included  

 

 
 

 
 

carbon pricing frameworks (e.g., carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs)76 that 
would address a majority of U.S. GHG emissions;  

sectoral approaches, such as a clean energy standard;  
funding or tax policies that support GHG-abating technology development and 
deployment;  
efforts to increase adaptation to climate change; and  
international cooperation.

On the other hand, some Members have introduced resolutions expressing that the multisector 
carbon pricing approaches are not in the economic interests of the United States.77 

Votes on comprehensive climate change proposals have been relatively rare in either chamber of 
Congress, although votes on proposals that may indirectly address climate change have been 
more common. For example, Congress has repeatedly enacted legislation with tax incentives for 
renewable energy and carbon capture and sequestration efforts.78 

Recently Enacted Legislation Related to GHGs  

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260), contained measures relevant to 
reducing GHG emissions, including the Energy Act of 2020 (Division Z) and the American 
Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020 (Division S, §103). The Energy Act of 2020 
promotes increased energy efficiency in homes, schools, and federal buildings; expands research 
and development in nuclear energy, energy storage, electric vehicles, renewable energy, and 
carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS); and promotes energy storage development, among 
other provisions.79 

The AIM Act of 2020 establishes a 15-year timeline to reduce domestic hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), a potent class of GHGs used in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, and directs 
the EPA to implement the requirements, including through regulations. AIM’s phasedown 
schedule appears to align with international commitments to phase down HFCs under the Kigali 
Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the 
Ozone Layer.80 EPA has begun developing a program to phase down HFCs under AIM Act 
authorities.81  

The 117th Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, S.J.Res. 14 (P.L. 117-23), on 
June 30, 2021, disapproving of the Trump Administration’s 2020 policy revisions of EPA’s 2016 
methane standards for the oil and natural gas sector. Although most of the requirements under 
EPA’s rule are back in force, their fate remains unclear because of pending legislative, executive, 
and judicial actions.82  

Legislative Proposals in the 117th Congress 
Majority leadership in both the House and the Senate in the 117th Congress have called for whole-
of-chamber approaches to addressing climate change.83 Members have introduced many

proposals that address climate change in some capacity, and climate change legislation has been 
referred to more than 35 committees.  

Among these proposals is legislation intended to modernize U.S. infrastructure and fund 
initiatives that may also increase climate resilience or reduce GHGs. In June 2021, a group of 
Senators reached agreement with President Biden on the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” 
(BIF), a $1.2 trillion plan that would authorize $579 billion in new spending on transportation 
infrastructure, power infrastructure, climate resiliency, and other initiatives.84 The BIF served as 
the basis for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), a substitute amendment (S.Amdt. 
2137) to H.R. 3684, which the Senate passed on August 10, 2021. IIJA is both an authorizing bill 
and an appropriations bill,85 and it would authorize funds for federal-aid highways, highway 
safety programs, water and electricity infrastructure, broadband, and other initiatives. IIJA would 
also provide funds intended to promote, among other things, clean energy and increased 
resilience of U.S. infrastructure, such as schools and ports. For example, IIJA would authorize 
funds for a Port Infrastructure Development Program, which would include projects “that 
improve the resiliency of ports to address sea-level rise, flooding, extreme weather events, 
earthquakes, and tsunami inundation, as well as projects that reduce or eliminate port-related 
criteria pollutant or greenhouse gas emission.”86 As of September 2021, the House had not 
considered IIJA.  

Congress has also considered climate change spending through its work on FY2022 budget 
reconciliation. Both chambers agreed to a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, S.Con.Res. 14, which 
established the congressional budget for FY2022, set budgetary levels for FY2023-FY2031, and 
provided reconciliation instructions to committees in the House and Senate.87 Among other 
things, S.Con.Res. 14 sought to authorize spending that would support the President’s goals of 
“80 percent clean electricity and 50 percent economy-wide carbon emissions reductions by 
2030.”88 It set a September 15, 2021, deadline for House and Senate committees to submit 
legislative language to their respective Budget Committees for the reconciliation package. The 
House Budget Committee combined the House committee markups into one bill, H.R. 5376,

85 Congress has established a process that provides for two separate types of   measures and 
appropriation measures. These measures perform different functions. Authorization acts establish, continue, or modify 
agencies or programs. An authorization act may also explicitly authorize subsequent appropriations for specific 
agencies and programs, frequently setting spending ceilings for them. See CRS Report R42388, The Congressional

which is also referred to as “The Build Back Better Act.” H.R. 5376 would provide funding, 
establish programs, and modify various “provisions relating to a broad array of areas, including 
education, labor, child care, health care, taxes, immigration, and the environment.” Among other 
things, the bill would provide funding for energy efficiency and weatherization projects; electric 
vehicles and zero-emission, heavy-duty vehicles; and transit services and “clean energy projects” 
in low-income communities. It also includes provisions for a methane fee for certain oil and 
natural gas facilities. As of September 27, 2021, the House Budget Committee approved H.R. 
5376 and reported it to the House of Representatives. 

Members of Congress have also introduced many other proposals addressing climate change in 
the 117th Congress. CRS identified over 750 bills in Congress.gov that address climate change in 
some capacity in the 117th Congress, as of September 27, 2021.89 CRS searched for bills by 
identifying climate-related key words in five broad categories: equity; land use; energy (including 
electricity, transportation, and energy efficiency); adaptation; and finance. These categories are 
summarized below.90 The categories are not mutually exclusive, given that many bills contain 
provisions that fall under more than one category. In particular, CRS identified seven bills, listed 
below, that appeared in all of the five broad categories, indicating that these bills span a 
potentially wide range of climate change topics. (See Appendix A for details about the search 
methodology.)  

  S. 283, “National Climate Bank Act,” sponsored by Senator Markey, and referred 

to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Latest action: 
Hearings held by Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, 
Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety (April 27, 2021).  
  S. 685, “America’s Clean Future Fund Act,” sponsored by Senator Durbin. Latest 
action: Read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance (March 10, 2021). 

  S. 1201, “United States Climate Leadership in International Mitigation, 

Adaptation, and Technology Enhancement Act of 2021,” sponsored by Senator 
Menendez. Latest action: Read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations (April 19, 2021). 

  H.R. 1512, “Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s 

Future Act,” or CLEAN Future Act, sponsored by Representative Pallone. Latest 
action: Referred to multiple House committees and subcommittees (March 3, 
2021).91 

  H.R. 1848, “Leading Infrastructure For Tomorrow’s America Act,” or “LIFT 

America Act,” sponsored by Representative Pallone. Latest action: Referred to 

89 Of the over 750 bills identified, 616 were introduced by Democrats, 9 by Independents, and 159 by Republicans;

five subcommittees of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
(March 12, 2021).92 

  H.R. 4309, “Clean Energy Innovation and Deployment Act of 2021,” sponsored 
by Representative DeGette. Latest action: Referred to the Subcommittee on 
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials of the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure (July 2, 2021). 

  H.R. 4350, “National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022,” 

sponsored by Representative Smith. Latest action as of the end of September: 
The Clerk was authorized to correct section numbers, punctuation, and cross 
references, and to make other necessary technical and conforming corrections in 
the engrossment of H.R. 4350 (September 23, 2021). 

Thirty-four of the more than 750 legislative proposals that CRS identified received floor 
consideration, as of September 27, 2021.93 Many of these bills fit into multiple broad topic 
categories. Also, some bills may contain only small provisions addressing climate change, while 
others are solely focused on a particular climate change topic in one or more of the five 
categories. Two of these bills (H.R. 3684 and H.R. 4350) fell into all five categories. Twenty-
seven of the 34 fell into the energy category, and 18 of the 34 fell into the adaptation category. 
The remainder of this section briefly describes each category and presents the status of proposals 
that have at least received floor consideration as of September 27, 2021. Table A-1 in Appendix 
A also provides a complete list of the bills that have at least received floor consideration.  

Additional CRS reports examine certain legislative approaches under consideration by some in 
the 117th Congress and prior Congresses:

  CRS Report R46691, Clean Energy Standards: Selected Issues for the 117th 

Congress, by Ashley J. Lawson.  

Adaptation  

As of September 27, 2021, CRS identified 197 bills introduced in the 117th Congress that seek to 
address adaptation in some capacity.94 This category includes proposals to address natural 

92 Subcommittees are as follows: Water Resources and Environment; Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation; 
Highways and Transit; Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management; and Aviation. For 
more details, including list of other House Committees to which the bill was referred, see  
  
93 Floor consideration includes House and Senate bills that have received consideration on the floor of either chamber 
including taking up, amending, debate, voting, passage, amendments between chambers, and conference actions. This 
bill status does not include actions taken in committees. For more information, see  help/
   
94 Scientific and programmatic literature defines adaptation in various ways. In addition, CRS has observed a general 
shift from a prevalence in federal use of the term climate change adaptation to a rise in the term resilience in the 
context of climate change. Adaptation often implies altering a system to accommodate persistent or long-term 
anticipated changes in the climate; this may involve system alterations that may not be necessary to enhance resilience 
to a static climate condition. Resilience is sometimes (but not always) considered as withstanding a hazard with a return 
to predisturbance conditions, or “bouncing back.” For more information, see CRS In Focus IF11827, Climate Change: 
Defining Adaptation and Resilience, with Implications for Policy, by Jane A. Leggett.

disasters, extreme weather events, coastal resilience, sea level rise, and more. Eighteen of these 
197 bills received at least floor consideration.  

Energy 

As of September 27, 2021, CRS identified 682 bills introduced in the 117th Congress that seek to 
address energy issues related to climate change. These bills represent the majority of the bills 
identified in all of the searches. For the purposes of this research, CRS defined energy broadly to 
include GHG emissions mitigation efforts in the electricity generation, residential and 
commercial, and transportation sectors. Examples of mitigation efforts include renewable energy 
incentives, energy efficiency incentives, methane emission reduction efforts, and proposals to 
alter fossil fuel production practices, among others. Bills in this category propose a wide range of 
policy options, including carbon pricing, tax incentives, grants, R&D, and others. Twenty-seven 
of these 682 bills received at least floor consideration. Of these, H.R. 1319 became law (The 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, P.L. 117-2).95  

Equity 

As of September 27, 2021, CRS identified 104 bills introduced in the 117th Congress that seek to 
address equity issues related to climate change.96 Bills identified in this search may include either 
an international or a domestic focus, or both. These bills include provisions to address issues such 
as community resilience, “just transitions” for the energy workforce, infrastructure, 
environmental justice, and other topics. Seven of these 104 bills received at least floor 
consideration and one, H.R. 1319, became law (The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, P.L. 117-
2).97  

Finance 

As of September 27, 2021, CRS identified 48 bills introduced in the 117th Congress concerning 
climate change and the financial industry. These bills include provisions regarding climate change 
risk disclosure and proposals to create climate or green banks, among others. Seven of these 48 
bills received floor consideration.  

Land Use 

As of September 27, 2021, CRS identified 117 bills introduced in the 117th Congress that seek to 
address land use issues related to climate change. These bills address deforestation, propose 
carbon sequestration efforts through forestry and agricultural practices, and include provisions 
regarding coastal resilience and adaptation, among others. Ten of these 117 bills received at least 
floor consideration.  

95 The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) is part of a series of legislative packages to address the impacts of 
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the economy, public health, state and local governments, 
individuals, and businesses (P.L. 117-2). ARPA provisions potentially relevant to energy and climate change issues 
include funding through FY2022 for the low-income home energy assistance program (Title II, §2911) and funding for 
public transportation agencies (Title III, §3401). 
96 While there is no single definition of equity in the context of climate change impacts, many define equity as entailing 
“fair” treatment of people according to their different circumstances.  
97 ARPA provided $100 million to EPA “to address health outcome disparities from pollution and the COVID-19 
pandemic” (P.L. 117-2, Title VI, §6002). For more information about EPA’s ARPA implementation, see EPA, 
“American Rescue Plan (ARP),”

Executive Branch Approach to Climate Change 
Mitigation  

GHG Targets 

Executive branch policies and actions influencing future U.S. GHG emissions are dependent on 
the policy objectives of each administration. After the United States rejoined the PA, the Biden 
Administration communicated a new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris 
Agreement,98 which contains a new GHG target for the United States: to reduce net GHG 
emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 levels by 2030.99 According to the Biden Administration, the 
NDC “exceeds a straight-line path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 
2050.”100 For comparison, the previous U.S. NDC, released in 2015, set a target of 26%-28% 
below 2005 levels by 2025, which President Obama had indicated was on a straight-line 
trajectory to a reduction of 80% below 2005 levels by 2050. The content of NDCs is nationally 
determined and nonbinding, but it should reflect what a Party to the PA intends to achieve.  

Figure 2 shows historical net GHG emissions with the 2015 and 2021 NDCs and the Biden 
Administration’s net-zero emissions goal for 2050. In 2019, U.S. GHG emissions, after 
accounting for removals by carbon sinks, were 5,769 MMTCO2e.101 The 2019 net GHG 
emissions are about 13% below net 2005 levels and about 4% above net 1990 levels. 

98 A key requirement of the Paris Agreement (PA) is that all Parties communicate their “Nationally Determined 
Contributions” (NDC) every five years, containing a GHG reduction pledge and actions, although this content of an 
NDC is not binding. As the United States has newly (again) become a Party, the United States must submit a new 
NDC.

101 As previously noted, U.S. gross emissions (not net of sinks) were 6,558 MMTCO2e in 2019. U.S. sinks removed 
about 789 MMT in 2019, about 12% of gross emissions (U.S. GHG Inventory, 1990-2019).

Source: Prepared by CRS; historical emissions from EPA, Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 
1990-2019, 2021,    
Notes: Net GHG emissions include net carbon sequestration from land use, land use change, and forestry. This 
involves carbon removals from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and storage in vegetation. Million metric tons 
of CO2 equivalent (MMTCO2e) is used because GHGs vary by global warming potential (GWP). GWP is an 
index that allows comparisons of the heat-trapping ability of different gases over a period of time. Consistent 
with international GHG reporting requirements, EPA’s most recent GHG inventory (April 2021) uses the GWP 
values presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 Fourth Assessment Report for 
warming potential over 100 years. 

The 2021 NDC also sets a goal to eliminate carbon emissions from the electricity sector by 2035. 
The Biden Administration reports that it will seek to decarbonize the energy sector in various 
ways, “including by cutting energy waste; shifting to carbon pollution-free electricity; electrifying 
and driving efficiency in vehicles, buildings, and parts of industry; and scaling up new energy 
sources and carriers.”102 

Announced Policies and Rulemakings 

In many respects, early executive orders and actions directed by the Biden Administration may be 
viewed as reinstatement and expansion of policies of the Obama Administration on climate 
change, with some important differences. In his first three months in office, President Biden 
rejoined the PA, announced U.S. GHG reduction targets, and centralized executive branch 
organizations to identify and coordinate climate-related actions. The remainder of this section 
describes the Biden Administration executive orders addressing climate change, as of September 
2021. Appendix B provides examples of additional climate-related policy actions, as summarized 
by White House statements, as of September 2021.  

Executive Order 13990, Protecting Public Health and the Environment and 
Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis 

Executive Order (E.O.) 13990 of January 20, 2021, outlined a federal policy  

to improve public health and protect our environment; to ensure access to clean air and 
water;  to  limit  exposure  to  dangerous  chemicals  and  pesticides;  to  hold  polluters

accountable, including those who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-
income  communities;  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions;  to  bolster  resilience  to  the 
impacts of climate change; to restore and expand our national treasures and monuments; 
and to prioritize both environmental justice and the creation of the well-paying union jobs 
necessary to deliver on these goals.103  

To this end, the order directed all executive departments and agencies to immediately review and, 
as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, consider suspending, revising, or rescinding 
actions promulgated, issued, or adopted between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021. The 
order specifically listed a number of climate-related actions by agencies to be reviewed by a 
given date, including EPA’s methane standards for the oil and natural gas sector, EPA’s and 
NHTSA’s GHG and fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks, and several of 
DOE’s efficiency improvements and appliance standards, among others.104 Further, the order 
directed heads of agencies, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to reinstate, or 
move forward with, several other climate-related actions, including proposing new methane 
guidelines on existing oil- and gas-sector sources, placing a temporary moratorium on the 
implementation of the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, establishing an interagency working group on the social cost of GHGs, and rescinding a 
number of executive actions, including the March 2019 permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and 
the Council on Environmental Quality’s 2019 draft GHG guidance on the National 
Environmental Policy Act, among others. It also stated that it is the Administration’s policy “to 
bolster resilience to the impacts of climate change,” and effectively reinstated several Obama 
Administration presidential documents related to climate change adaptation.105

Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad 

E.O. 14008 of January 27, 2021, ordered a whole-of-government approach to addressing climate 
change and set forth a number of directives with a view toward decisions that support meeting the 
Administration’s GHG reduction targets.106 The order created a new position of the Special 
Presidential Envoy for Climate. To coordinate across agencies, E.O. 14008 established a White 
House Office of Domestic Climate Policy (Climate Policy Office) within the Executive Office of 
the President led by an Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor.  

E.O. 14008 also established a National Climate Task Force, which is chaired by the National 
Climate Advisor and composed of departments and major agencies. The order instructed the 
National Climate Task Force to organize the whole-of-government approach to addressing 
climate change and to facilitate planning and implementation of federal actions. In particular, 
E.O. 14008 instructed task force members to “prioritize action on climate change in their policy-
making and budget processes, in their contracting and procurement, and in their engagement with 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; workers and communities; and leaders across all 
sectors of our economy.”107 

E.O. 14008 called for additional actions, including the following: 

  Adaptation. Federal agencies must develop Climate Action Plans to improve 

adaptation and resilience to climate changes. After review by the Federal Chief 
Sustainability Officer,108 agencies must report annually on their implementation 
of the plans.  

  Conservation, Agriculture, and Forestry. E.O. 14008 called for development 
of certain strategies and reports related to conservation, agriculture, and forestry. 
It called for a strategy to create a Civilian Climate Corps to provide jobs and 
training for conservation, restoration, resilience, carbon sequestration, and other 
objectives.109 The E.O. called for a report recommending steps to achieve 
conservation of at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, and included 
mechanisms to measure progress toward that goal. A preliminary report was 
released on May 6, 2021.110 E.O. 14008 also addressed the potential role of 
farming in addressing climate change and reducing GHG emissions, highlighting 
opportunities to promote carbon sequestration in soils and to source sustainable 
bioproducts and biofuels. It required USDA to solicit stakeholder input and issue

and in offshore waters, with a goal to double offshore wind production by 
2030.112 It also directed the Secretary to pause new oil and gas leases on public 
lands or offshore waters pending review and reconsideration of federal oil and 
gas leasing and permitting practices. It directed the Secretary to consider, among 
other things, potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas 
activities on federal lands and to consider adjusting royalty rates for coal, oil, and 
gas extracted from public lands or to take other actions to account for climate 
costs.113  

  Foreign Policy and National Security. E.O. 14008 increased the prioritization 

of international actions on climate change, as compared to actions under 
President Obama and President Trump, establishing the policy that “climate 
considerations shall be an essential element of United States foreign policy and 
national security.”114 The Special Presidential Envoy for Climate sits on the 
National Security Council (NSC), representing the first time the NSC includes a 
principal fully dedicated to climate change.115 E.O. 14008 also called for relevant 
federal agencies to coordinate with the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate to 
develop strategies and implementation plans for integrating climate 
considerations into their international work.116  
Infrastructure. E.O. 14008 directed the Chair of the Council on Environmental 
Quality (CEQ) and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
to (1) ensure that investments in federal infrastructure reduce GHGs; (2) require 
that permitting decisions consider GHG emission impacts; and (3) identify steps 
to accelerate clean energy and transmission projects.117  

 

  Procurement. E.O. 14008 established a policy to align management of federal 

procurement and real property to “support robust climate action.”118 In particular, 
it called for the National Climate Advisor and National Climate Task Force, 
assisted by the heads of relevant federal agencies, to develop a plan that uses 
available procurement authorities to achieve or facilitate a decarbonized 
electricity sector by 2035 and the use of clean and zero-emission vehicles for 
federal, state, local, and tribal government fleets.119  

  Transition and Equity (Energy Communities). E.O. 14008 established an 
Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and 
Economic Revitalization (IWG). The order directed the IWG, which is housed 
within DOE, to coordinate the delivery of federal resources “to revitalize the 
economies of coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities,” develop strategies

for economic and social recovery, and evaluate “opportunities to ensure benefits 
and protections for coal and power plant workers.”120  

  Transition and Equity (Justice40 Initiative). E.O. 14008 established the 
Justice40 Initiative to recommend, in consultation with disadvantaged 
communities, how to direct certain federal investments such that 40% would flow 
to “disadvantaged communities.”121 The Administration published “initial 
recommendations” on July 20, 2021.122 According to the order, the scope of those 
federal investments includes clean energy and energy efficiency; clean transit; 
affordable and sustainable housing; training and workforce development; 
remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and critical clean water 
infrastructure. The initiative must publish an annual Environmental Justice 
Scorecard.  

Executive Order 14027, Establishment of the Climate Change Support Office  

E.O. 14027 of May 7, 2021, established, within the Department of State, a temporary 
organization called the Climate Change Support Office (CCSO).123 The purpose of the CCSO is 
to support “bilateral and multilateral engagement to advance the United States’ initiative to 
address” climate change.124 The CCSO is also intended to “support efforts that go beyond the 
climate work currently carried out by the Department of State across a wide range of international 
fora that address clean energy, aviation, shipping, the Artic [sic], the ocean, sustainable 
development, and migration.”125  

Executive Order 14030, Climate-Related Financial Risk 

E.O. 14030 of May 20, 2021, directed federal agencies, including financial regulators, to analyze 
and mitigate the risks that climate change poses to financial stability.126 It called for the 
development of a comprehensive, government-wide strategy that identifies climate-related 
financial risk to government programs, assets, and liabilities. It also required the strategy to 
identify financing needs associated with climate change goals, including achieving net-zero 
greenhouse gas emissions for the U.S. economy by no later than 2050. The order directed 
financial regulators to assess climate-related financial risks and issue a report that discusses 
current federal efforts to incorporate climate-related risks into policies and programs. The order 
also directed agencies to consider taking actions to protect life savings and pensions from 
climate-related financial risk, and to consider updating procurement and budgetary processes to 
account for climate-related risk analyses.

Executive Order 14037, Strengthening American Leadership in Clean Cars 
and Trucks 

E.O. 14037 of August 5, 2021, set a nonbinding goal for electrification in the transportation 
section, namely that 50% of all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission 
vehicles, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, or fuel cell electric vehicles.127 The 
order also directed EPA and NHTSA to begin work on future rulemakings for multipollutant 
emissions, including for greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel economy standards for light- and 
medium-duty vehicles beginning with model year (MY) 2027 and extending at least through MY 
2030. Further, the agencies are to begin work on new nitrogen oxides standards beginning in MY 
2027, updated GHG emission standards for MYs 2027-2029, and new GHG emission and fuel 
efficiency standards beginning in MY 2030, for heavy-duty engines and vehicles. 

In conjunction with the release of E.O. 14037, the Biden Administration proposed amendments to 
the existing CAFE and light-duty vehicle GHG emission standards through MY 2026.128 The 
proposal was not a joint rulemaking. EPA and NHTSA released their proposals separately, with 
different MY requirements, target stringencies, and compliance flexibilities. However, both 
proposals would increase in stringency by approximately 25% between MYs 2023 and 2026, 
achieving a projected fleet-wide, sales-weighted fuel economy of roughly 48 miles per gallon in 
2026. In addition to the amended standards, NHTSA has proposed to fully repeal the SAFE 
Vehicles Rule, Part One: One National Program,129 and EPA has announced that it is 
reconsidering the 2019 withdrawal of California’s CAA preemption waiver.130 

FY2022 Budget Request 

E.O. 14008 identifies the budget process as another task through which agencies shall, to the 
extent permitted by law, prioritize action on climate change.131 The President’s FY2022 budget 
request, released May 28, 2021, included specific proposals aimed at reducing GHG emissions. 
For example, the FY2022 budget request included an Administration initiative on infrastructure, 
the American Jobs Plan, which would invest in climate and clean infrastructure projects, among 
other things.132 For more information, see Appendix B.  

The President’s FY2022 budget request stated that in addition to the American Jobs Plan, the 
Administration proposed an increase of over $14 billion of federal funding, compared to FY2021, 
to support GHG reductions and increasing adaptation or resilience to climate-related impacts.133

The President’s FY2022 budget request included, among other proposals, the following:134 

  Clean Energy Projects and Workforce Development. The President’s FY2022 
budget states that it would provide $2 billion for “welders, electricians, and other 
skilled laborers” to build clean energy projects.135 

  Clean Energy, Energy Storage, and Transmission Projects in Rural 

Communities. The President’s FY2022 budget states that it would provide $6.5 
billion for lending.136 

  Agriculture and Conservation. The President’s FY2022 budget states that it 

would provide more than $300 million in “new investments in the next 
generation of agriculture and conservation,” which would include support for 
voluntary private lands conservation, renewable energy grants and loans, and 
creation of the Civilian Climate Corps.137  

  Efficiency Grants. The President’s FY2022 budget states that it would provide 

$1.7 billion for retrofits to homes, schools, and federal buildings.138 

  Environmental Justice. The President’s FY2022 budget states that it would 
provide more than $1.4 billion to support “marginalized and overburdened 
communities,” including $936 million toward a new initiative, Accelerating 
Environmental and Economic Justice.139 The FY2022 budget also proposes an 
increase of more than $450 million to support climate mitigation, resilience, 
adaptation, and environmental justice projects in Indian Country.140 

  Federal Procurement and Electric Vehicles. The President’s FY2022 budget 
states that it would provide $600 million for federal zero-emission vehicles and 
charging infrastructure.141 

  GHG Reductions Under Existing Authorities. The President’s FY2022 budget 
requests $1.8 billion for EPA programs to address climate change, a $100 million 
increase for air quality grants to states and tribes to implement programs and 
reduce GHGs under the Clean Air Act, and an additional $60 million to research 
climate change impacts on health and the environment.142 
International Climate Change Financing. The President’s FY2022 budget 
requests $2.5 billion for international climate change programs.143 It includes a

$1.2 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and $485 million to 
support other multilateral climate initiatives, including $100 million for 
international climate adaptation programs.144 Also the President’s budget requests 
about $700 million for the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International 
Development to assist developing countries in adapting to climate disruptions, to 
invest in clean energy, and to reduce GHG “landscape emissions.”145 

  Methane Reductions from Oil and Gas Systems. The President’s FY2022 

budget requests over $580 million to “remediate thousands of abandoned oil and 
gas wells and reclaim abandoned mines” in order to reduce methane leakage.146 

  Technology Research, Development, and Demonstration. The President’s 

FY2022 budget requests more than $10 billion in “clean energy innovation across 
nondefense agencies.”147 For example, DOE requested more than $8 billion in 
clean energy and climate innovation to develop “advanced” nuclear energy 
technologies,148 electric vehicles, “green hydrogen,”149 and innovative 
approaches to air conditioning and refrigeration.150 The President’s budget 
request includes a total of $1 billion to establish a new Advanced Research 
Projects Agency for Climate (ARPA-C), and invest in the existing Advanced 
Research Projects Agency-Energy, which would both support high-risk funding 
of climate change   and GHG mitigation technology 
development.151 The Administration expects to house ARPA-C at DOE.152 
Additional agencies contributing to ARPA-C include the departments of 
Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, 
the Interior, and Transportation, and EPA.153 Secretary of Energy Jennifer

Granholm indicated that the current proposal would initiate “a path to quadruple 
clean energy research government-wide in four years.”154 

  Transportation Incentives. The President’s FY2022 budget requests a $174 

billion investment in the electric vehicle market, including support for domestic 
manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles, consumer point-of-sale rebates 
and tax incentives to purchase electric vehicles manufactured in the United 
States, and establishment of grants and incentive programs to build a network of 
electric vehicle chargers.155 The President’s FY2022 budget also proposes to 
invest $80 billion for rail improvements, including the development and adoption 
of clean energy rail propulsion systems, such as near-zero emission diesel 
locomotives, battery technology, and electrification.156 

As of September 2021, congressional debate has continued on annual appropriations for FY2022. 
Appropriators in each chamber have supported some of the Biden Administration’s proposals to 
varying degrees. For more information, see the CRS collection of reports on FY2022 
appropriations.157  

Congress has also considered climate change spending through its work on FY2022 budget 
reconciliation. Both chambers agreed to a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, S.Con.Res. 14, which 
established the congressional budget for FY2022, set budgetary levels for FY2023-FY2031, and 
provided reconciliation instructions to committees in the House and Senate.158 For more 
information, see “Legislative Proposals in the 117th Congress.”  

Issues for Congress 
The Biden Administration has increased the ambition of domestic GHG reduction goals compared 
to previous Administrations, aiming to achieve “net zero” emissions in the next three decades. It 
has signaled it will pursue its GHG reduction goals through a variety of climate change actions, 
including both regulatory and nonregulatory measures. Some observers have expressed 
skepticism that the Administration’s GHG reduction goals can be reached absent new or 
enhanced authorities and appropriations from Congress. As the Biden Administration begins to 
implement a whole-of-government approach to climate change, Congress may consider issues 
concerning U.S. GHG targets, policy approaches, and funding.

GHG Targets and International Commitments  

The Biden Administration rejoined the PA, which seeks to hold the GHG-induced “increase in 
global average temperature to well below 2o Celsius (C)” and to try to limit it to 1.5oC.159 In 
particular, the PA includes a collective commitment to achieve approximately net-zero GHG 
emissions in the second half of this century.160 The United States established a new pledge to 
reduce its economy-wide net GHG emissions by 50%-52% below the 2005 level by 2030, in a 
required communication, the U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the PA. See 
Figure 2 for historical net GHG emissions compared with these goals.161 The target itself is not 
binding. The U.S. NDC also stated that the target “exceeds a straight-line path to achieve net-zero 
emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.”162 The pledges made in the U.S. NDC and 
other parties’ NDCs to 2030 are intended to support near-term steps in a multidecadal process to 
avoid adverse impacts on people, economies, and the environmental systems on which societies 
depend.  

U.S. participation in the PA raises issues that Congress may consider, such as the ambition of the 
U.S. NDC and assessment of other parties’ NDCs. Members may be interested in the actions 
required to fulfill the U.S. NDC, the efficacy of such actions, and the economic and equity 
implications of such actions. Congress may consider assessing the ambition, relative level of 
effort, and performance of other parties’ GHG mitigation, adaptation, technology, and financing 
associated with the PA. It could request the executive branch to provide such analysis, conduct its 
own assessment, or rely on third parties.  

Differences in the scope, stringency, and timing of parties’ GHG policies may raise concerns for 
policymakers. One concern many have is that U.S. policies could raise U.S. prices more than the 
prices of goods manufactured in countries with relatively less stringent climate policies, 
potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for some domestic businesses. Certain businesses 
could potentially become less profitable, lose market share, and reduce jobs. In addition, climate 
policy differences between countries could potentially lead to emissions leakage, which “occurs 
when economic activity is shifted as a result of the emission control regulation and, as a result, 
emission abatement achieved in one location [e.g., the United States] that is subject to emission 
control regulation is [diminished] by increased emissions in unregulated locations.”163 

Policymakers might consider approaches to address these potential outcomes in several ways. 
One approach that has received interest in recent years is a border carbon adjustment (BCA) 
mechanism. Several national governments and the EU have discussed imposing BCAs on 
imported goods from countries that do not make similarly ambitious efforts to reduce GHG 
emissions. A BCA would likely apply a tariff to emission-intensive imported goods such as steel, 

159 PA, Article 2. 
160 In order to achieve the PA’s “long-term temperature goal,” parties aim to make their GHG emissions peak as soon 
as possible and then reduce them rapidly “so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and 
removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century”; see PA, Article 4. For more information, see

aluminum, cement, and certain chemicals. Also, China, South Korea, European countries, and 
others are pursuing investment in low-GHG-emitting technologies in advanced energy, materials, 
electronics, vehicles, and other sectors that they expect to provide future competitiveness 
advantages.164 

Transparency and verification of GHG reductions is another issue potentially of interest to 
Congress. Some Members may be concerned about whether parties to the PA are taking actions 
and will achieve their GHG targets. Scientific advances in remote sensing systems, ground-based 
measurements, and modeling can help the United States and other countries independently verify 
where entities may be meeting their GHG targets, and where they may be falling behind. 
Congress may be interested in the federal and international programs that support, or could 
enhance support for, greater transparency of reporting, verification, and review of GHG emissions 
and related actions. 

U.S. Federal Policy Approaches 

If Congress seeks to limit or remove GHG emissions from the atmosphere, then there are a range 
of policy options it may consider.165 For example, options include carbon pricing, regulatory 
approaches, investment in research and development, tax incentives, and federal procurement 
requirements. A number of these policy tools are currently being implemented in the United 
States—as discussed earlier in this report—and in other countries, to varying degrees and to 
support a range of policy objectives.  

If there is interest in legislating a national climate mitigation strategy, Congress may assess a 
range of potential concerns and how particular policies could be designed to address them. 
Members frequently raise questions about the potential costs of policies and alternative policy 
designs. Congress may also consider options that help alleviate some of the expected negative 
consequences from certain emissions mitigation policies. These consequences may include 
economy-wide impacts, disproportionate costs to lower-income households, and job losses in 
certain industries, among others. When examining these concerns, policymakers may wish to 
evaluate the tradeoff between the estimated consequences from mitigation policies and the 
benefits of reducing emissions and avoiding climate change, among other considerations.  

Many actions to reduce GHG emissions may bring   effects beyond the 
intended GHG reduction benefits. An example is reduced health care costs and mortality 
associated with improvements in air quality (e.g., from reductions in non-GHG emissions). 
Factors relevant to the extent of co-benefits include policy design and depth of GHG reductions. 

Congress, in its oversight role, may also consider the feasibility, challenges, and economic 
impacts associated with the Biden Administration’s GHG targets. Some recent studies have 
examined pathways that rely partly on federal policies to reduce domestic GHG or CO2 emissions 
in the next decade.166 While a synthesis of these studies is beyond the scope of this report, such

studies highlight issues for congressional consideration, including options and incentives to 
accelerate development and deployment of decarbonization technologies and regulations for 
sector-specific or economy-wide emissions targets, should that be a goal. In particular, studies 
indicate that achieving these emission reduction targets would generally rely on, among other 
things, increasing use of renewable energy and decreasing use of unabated coal for power 
generation (i.e., coal-fired generation that does not use carbon capture and sequestration), 
electrification of end-uses (i.e., replacing technologies that rely on fossil fuel combustion with 
electrical ones), energy efficiency improvements, reductions in methane leaks in the oil and gas 
sector, and maintenance of the carbon sink in natural and working lands.167 

A question policymakers may consider is whether economy-wide or sectoral targets—such as 
decarbonization of the electricity sector—could be achieved under existing federal authorities as 
well as through state and local climate change actions. Examples of existing authorities include 
Clean Air Act regulations, energy efficiency standards, and renewable portfolio standards. Among 
other considerations, it is unclear whether one of these existing authorities—the Clean Air Act—
is well-suited to the Administration’s climate change goals or whether it could achieve the more 
ambitious targets supported by some Members and stakeholders. Members supporting 
decarbonization might consider legislative options, should existing authorities appear inadequate 
to achieve emission reduction objectives. As discussed in “Legislative Proposals in the 117th 
Congress,” Congress continues to deliberate new authorities and spending to set and achieve 
specific GHG reductions, provide tax and other financial incentives to businesses and consumers, 
and set regulatory performance standards (including clean energy standards), among other policy 
options.  

Climate Change Funding 

Congress may consider how federal funding, including appropriations, might influence the 
Administration’s climate change actions. Congress is currently deliberating FY2022 
appropriations and budget reconciliation options. As discussed in this report, President Biden 
directed agencies to prioritize action on climate change through the budget process, among other 
things, and his Administration’s FY2022 budget request included specific proposals aimed at 
reducing GHG emissions. The Administration’s American Jobs Plan appeared to anticipate that 
hundreds of billions of dollars in new federal funding and tax incentives would stimulate 
technological advancements and enhance competitiveness of low- or no-GHG emitting 
technologies, and hence facilitate a long-term transition to a substantially modified and net-zero-
emissions economy. Senate Majority Leader Schumer released a letter to colleagues with 
preliminary estimates of reductions from proposed provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act and budget reconciliation.168 While the bills have not been enacted as of September 
2021, he reported that, with 

the combined impact of both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Budget 
Resolution’s instructions, we are on track to reduce U.S. emissions to approximately 45 
percent beneath 2005 levels by 2030. When you add Administrative actions being planned

by the Biden Administration and many states - like New York, California, and Hawaii - we 
will hit our 50 percent target by 2030. 

The federal government has long supported research and development efforts beyond those the 
private sector pursues, with investments in, among other areas, science, technology development, 
and economic research. Federal research funding could help shape the direction and pace of 
technological developments that many expect could achieve significant reductions in emissions, 
or could lower costs, compared with current commercial technologies. Some advocate that further 
innovation would be useful, and in some instances required, to abate emissions from the industrial 
sector.169 Congress may look to provide funding for alternative technologies, whether through 
research and development, or infrastructure planning. Congress may also consider options to 
incentivize consumer purchases, either through tax incentives, mandates, or government 
procurement policies.  

Members of Congress have expressed differing viewpoints concerning the scope of IIJA and the 
Build Back Better Act and each proposal’s spending priorities.170 Some Members of Congress 
have called for greater spending on climate change and social programs, such as education and 
health care. Other Members of Congress have raised concerns that total proposed spending levels 
are too high and that these legislative proposals invest in climate change and social programs at 
the expense of programs, such as roads and bridges, they regard as higher priorities.  

Finally, Congress appropriates funds for the State Department’s and Department of the Treasury’s 
contributions to foreign assistance. Further, Congress has sole authority to lay tariffs and regulate 
foreign commerce—the most direct way being through Trade Promotion Authority. That is, it is 
the authority that Congress uses to establish trade-negotiating objectives. The most recent 
authority (P.L. 114-26) expired on July 1, 2021. Congress may consider whether any new 
authority should be written to include objectives on climate. 

169 For further information on the potential role of research and development, see GHG-related sections in CRS Report 
R46787, Science and Technology Issues in the 117th Congress, coordinated by Frank Gottron and Brian E. Humphreys. 
170 Members of Congress have also disagreed about various other provisions of the legislative proposals, such as the tax 
provisions in the Build Back Better Act.

Appendix A. Climate Change Legislation in the 
117th Congress: Search Methodology  
The “Legislative Proposals in the 117th Congress” section of this report identified bills by 
running a number of searches in Congress.gov, an authoritative and up-to-date resource for 
legislation, which is updated daily when Congress is in session. Initial searches were run in May 
2021 and subsequent searches were run to update legislation until September 27, 2021. CRS 
compiled a list of search terms related to adaptation, greenhouse gas emissions (including sources 
of emissions by economic sector), climate change mitigation (including technologies), climate 
change impacts, climate change economics, climate change finance, and research and 
development. CRS also sought to include terms relevant to climate change policy at an 
international scale (such as potential U.S. participation in international agreements or bilateral or 
multilateral funding assistance). CRS grouped these terms within five broad categories: 
adaptation, energy, equity, finance, and land use. Each of the five searches was run in the full text 
of all legislation introduced in the 117th Congress, and results were downloaded into Excel for 
analysis.171 Individual search results were tagged with the broad topic tag associated with the 
search from which they resulted (i.e., “adaptation” or “finance”). Duplicate bills (i.e., bills that 
were identified in more than one search) were assigned a broad topic tag for each search in which 
they were identified, and then all but one listing was removed from analysis. Amendments and 
resolutions were also removed from the spreadsheet. CRS identified a number of bills as not 
relevant—meaning these bills contained search terms but did not translate to relevant 
provisions—by reviewing titles, summaries (where available), and full text. CRS removed these 
bills from consideration. CRS also included all relevant related and companion bills (as identified 
in Congress.gov) in analysis. Additional searches were run using the “introducedDate:” function 
in Congress.gov to identify both newly introduced legislation as well as updated bill status and 
other metadata that may have changed since the prior search. 

Bill Status Table 

Table A-1 was created by using Congress.gov’s “Status of Legislation” filter in each set of search 
results. Each set of results was limited to the following statuses: Became Public Law, Passed Both 
Chambers, Passed One Chamber, or Floor Consideration. Thirty-four of the more than 750 
legislative proposals that CRS identified progressed beyond introduction in the legislative 
process, as of September 27, 2021, and are identified in Table A-1. Many of these bills fit into 
multiple broad topic categories. Also, some bills may contain relatively small provisions 
addressing climate change, while others are solely focused on that topic in one or more sectors. 
Twenty-seven of the 34 bills fell within the energy category, and 18 of the 34 fell within the 
adaptation category. Table A-1 reflects the September 27, 2021, search, the most recent search 
conducted for this report.

Search Limitations 

These searches reflect the best available information from Congress.gov within the specified time 
frame, but there are some limitations. First, there are many ways to define, consider, and address 
climate change. Legislative proposals may specify climate change as an objective. Other 
proposals that may be considered directly or indirectly relevant to climate change may not 
expressly state climate change as an objective. Some bills may contain only small provisions that 
met search criteria, while others are solely focused on addressing climate change in one or more 
sectors. Stakeholders may also disagree about the extent to which proposals may be relevant to 
climate change. CRS designed broad searches in an effort to capture the many ways that 
Members of Congress and stakeholders have considered climate change. Given the broad scope 
and variability of the subject matter, these and any other searches for “climate change legislation” 
should be viewed as illustrative rather than a definitive record. 

Second, the search results should be viewed as a snapshot in time. Bills typically change as they 
move through the legislative process, both in content and for procedural reasons. In some 
instances, the searches may not have captured all such revisions. As previously noted, the 
Congress.gov database is updated daily when Congress is in session, but the full text of different 
bill versions and additional metadata may be added over time, affecting search results.

U.S. Climate Change Policy 

Appendix B. Selected Additional Actions in the 
Executive Branch 
The Biden Administration has begun implementing its whole-of-government approach to 
addressing climate change. This appendix identifies examples of climate-related policy actions as 
summarized by the following White House statements, in alphabetical order, as of September 
2021. The actions and proposals summarized in this section do not constitute a comprehensive list 
of efforts by the Biden Administration. 

  American Jobs Plan. The Administration’s American Jobs Plan proposed a total 
of $2 trillion in federal funding and outlined many incentives and investments in 
U.S. jobs, infrastructure, and market competitiveness. The plan targeted 40% of 
the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure investments to disadvantaged 
communities. The plan also proposed to invest in rural communities and 
communities affected by the market-based transition to clean energy, among 
other climate change initiatives.172 It called on Congress to fund $35 billion “to 
achieve technology breakthroughs that address the climate crisis and position 
America as the global leader in clean energy technology and clean energy 
jobs.”173 Congressional deliberations subsequently focused on a different but 
related infrastructure plan, known as the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” 
(BIF), a $1.2 trillion plan that would authorize $579 billion in new spending on 
transportation infrastructure, power infrastructure, climate resiliency, and other 
initiatives.174 A group of Senators reached agreement with President Biden on the 
BIF and drafted legislation. See “Legislative Proposals in the 117th Congress” 
for more information. 

  Building Modernization Proposals. There are a number of proposals to fund 
building modernization. For example, CEQ, DOE, the General Services 
Administration (GSA), and EPA announced $30 million in new federal 
investments to modernize and upgrade the nation’s residential and commercial 
buildings to be affordable, resilient, accessible, energy efficient, and 
electrified.175 As another example, DOE requested an increase of $387 million 
for the Federal Energy Efficiency Fund to improve the climate resilience of 
federal buildings.176

  Climate Innovation Working Group Formation. The Administration 

announced a Climate Innovation Working Group and discussed funding to 
support “transformational low-carbon energy technologies.”177 

  Coal and Power Plant Community Economic Revitalization Plan. The 

Administration released a report that identifies communities affected by coal 
mine and power plant closures (“energy communities”) that should be prioritized 
for federal investment, details existing resources for these communities, and 
provides recommendations for further actions.178 

  Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Plan. The departments of 

Transportation and Energy, and the GSA, announced a suite of actions intended 
to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles and charging stations.179 
  Financial Sector Oversight (Assessing Climate Risks and Disclosures). U.S. 

financial regulators and the Biden Administration have taken public steps toward 
focusing financial regulatory attention on assessing climate risks to the financial 
system, including whether, and how, current standards for disclosure of climate 
risks are being followed and how they might be updated. The Biden 
Administration is reportedly working on a government-wide strategy, under an 
upcoming executive order, to better assess climate-related risks for public and 
private financial assets.180 Several key financial agencies have announced they 
are looking at updating existing climate-related risk guidance. Treasury Secretary 
Janet Yellen flagged climate change as “an existential threat” and the biggest 
emerging risk to the health of the U.S. financial system, at the first meeting of the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), established after the 2008 
financial crisis so the heads of financial agencies could coordinate regarding 
emerging risks.181 She reiterated in a July 11, 2021, speech that the FSOC would 
assess the potential risk climate change may pose to the financial stability of the 
United States, and would complement the SEC’s work on improved financial 
disclosures of climate-related risks.182

U.S. Climate Change Policy 

  Financial Sector Oversight (Federal Reserve). On January 25, 2021, the 
Federal Reserve announced the creation of an internal Supervision Climate 
Committee (SCC) to “strengthen the Federal Reserve’s capacity to identify and 
assess financial risks from climate change” and to “develop an appropriate 
program to ensure the resilience of supervised firms to climate-related financial 
risks.”183 In March 2021, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of a 
Financial Stability Climate Committee (FSCC) to identify, assess, and address 
climate-related risks to financial stability from a macro-prudential perspective.184 
On July 11, 2021, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Randall Quarles flagged the 
Financial Stability Board’s (FSB’s) publication of a roadmap for addressing 
climate-related financial risks.185 The FSB roadmap is aimed at supporting 
international coordination of climate disclosures for standard-setting bodies 
internationally,186 although Quarles did not specifically address any additional 
steps by the United States or the Federal Reserve. On December 15, 2020, the 
Federal Reserve Board joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for 
Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a group of central banks and supervisory 
authorities from around the world developing best practices on climate risk 
management for the financial sector.187 

  Financial Sector Oversight (Securities Disclosures). On July 28, 2021, 

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said he had 
requested that the SEC’s staff develop a mandatory climate risk disclosure rule 
proposal for the commission’s consideration by the end of 2021.188 He noted that 
such mandatory disclosures should be “consistent and comparable,” enabling 
investors to compare both qualitative and quantitative metrics across 
companies.189 He suggested quantitative disclosures could include metrics related 
to greenhouse gas emissions, financial impacts of climate change, and progress 
toward climate-related goals.190 In February 2021, the former Acting Chair of the 
SEC, Allison Herren Lee, directed the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance to

 

enhance its focus on climate-related disclosure in public company filings.191 She 
noted that the SEC would assess compliance related to disclosure of climate 
change risks under the SEC’s existing 2010 guidance, and would start updating 
that 2010 SEC guidance.192 The SEC also announced in March 2021 the creation 
of a “Climate and ESG [Environmental, Social and Governance] Task Force” 
within the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to identify ways to proactively 
identify ESG-related misconduct.193 
International Climate Finance Plan. U.S. agencies that work with development 
partners (e.g., the departments of State and the Treasury, U.S. Agency for 
International Development, the Millennium Challenge Corporation) announced a 
plan containing directives to (1) mobilize financial resources, both public and 
private, to assist developing countries to reduce and/or avoid greenhouse gas 
emissions and build resilience and adapt to the impacts of climate change; (2) 
scale back public investments in carbon-intensive fossil-fuel-based energy; (3) 
make international capital flows consistent with low-emissions, climate-resilient 
pathways; and (4) better define, measure, and report U.S. international climate 
finance. The plan states an intention to double, by 2024, the U.S. annual public 
climate finance to developing countries, including tripling its annual adaptation 
finance, “relative to the average level during the second half of the Obama 
Administration.”194 According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the 
average annual funding for climate change international assistance over the 
period 2013-2016 was $1.177 billion.195 

  Offshore Wind Energy Plan. The U.S. departments of the Interior, Energy, 

Commerce, and Transportation announced new leasing, funding, and 
development goals to accelerate and deploy offshore wind energy.196 
  Paris Agreement Accession. The Administration accepted on behalf of the 

United States the Paris Agreement, the second major subsidiary agreement for 
international cooperation under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.197

192 Acting SEC Chair Allison Herren Lee, “Statement on the Review of Climate-Related Disclosure,” February 24, 
2021,   Since total market 
capitalization of the U.S. stock market at the end of 2020 was roughly $50.8 trillion, the financial implications of 
adequate disclosure of risks from climate change for equity investors is potentially large. The $50.8 trillion figure 
represents the total market capitalization of all U.S.-based public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, 
Nasdaq Stock Market, or OTCQX U.S. Market, according to Siblis Research, “Total Market Value of U.S. Stock

  President Biden’s Leaders Summit on Climate. The Administration convened 

a summit with “heads of state and government, as well as leaders and 
representatives from international organizations, businesses, subnational 
governments, and indigenous communities” to discuss international climate 
ambition, among other things.198 

  Resilience Funding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 

announced three pre-disaster funding opportunities intended to help states and 
communities increase their preparedness in advance of climate-related extreme 
weather events and other disasters, and improve their ability to recover after 
these events. The FEMA initiatives include (1) $1 billion in funding for its 
Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program for FY2021; 
(2) $3.46 billion in funding for its Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP); 
and (3) $160 million in funding for its Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant 
program for FY2021.199 

  U.S.-Germany Climate and Energy Partnership. President Biden and German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel jointly launched the U.S.-Germany Climate and 
Energy Partnership.200
